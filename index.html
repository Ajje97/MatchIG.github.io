<h1> Artificial Intelligence â€“ How Does It Affect Our Daily Lives? </h1>

<h3>Background & Motivation</h3>

<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is a topic that is becoming an increasingly important focus of research and business. This is due to its enormous potential and the fact that it already has an impact on many aspects of our lives. AI technologies are expected to gain in importance and market research institutes see great potential and growth opportunities in this field. AI is a versatile technology that can solve problems in society and the economy, such as medical diagnostics and industrial efficiency. It can also be used to accelerate the analysis of large amounts of research data in science. </p>

<p>Despite the potential of AI, a 2022 Pew Research survey found that 37 percent of respondents are more concerned than excited about AI. There are fears about job losses, privacy and the potential for AI to "outperform human capabilities". It is clear that AI is a complex and controversial topic, which is why it is important to understand the basics of this subject. That is why our assignment is devoted to this topic.</p>
